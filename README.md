# Horiseon - Landing Page Accessibility Refactoring

![Last commit badge](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/qkr0wns/webpage-accessibility)

## Description
Given Horiseon's landing page, I updated its codebase to ensure the site meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.
And to improve future maintenance of the codebase, I cleaned up its HTML and CSS without changing its core appearance.

## Changenotes

### Improved SEO and accessibility of Horiseon's landing page
- Refactored `div`s to semantic HTML elements: `header`, `footer`, `section`, `aside`, `nav`.
- Added a more descriptive `title` element.
- Added descriptive `alt` attributes to images.
- Updated the background color of the aside to meet WCAG accessibility standards.
- Fixed navigation link.

### Cleaned up HTML and CSS

- DRYed and condensed repetitive CSS and adjusted HTML as appropriate.
- Reorganized style.css to reflect page layout and added comments to indicate page sections for better readability.
